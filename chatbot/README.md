# How to install PostgreSQL on a Mac

1. Download the PostgreSQL 9.5 installer from https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads and follow the installation instructions

   `PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin:$PATH"`

# How to add a PostgreSQL migration script 

This strategy assumes that each migration script in the `db` directory has a unique positive integer migration ID,
and that each script's migration ID is exactly one greater than the previous script's migration ID. 
Otherwise, the scripts will not run.

1. Copy `db/000-template.sql` and name it with its migration ID (padded with zeros) followed by a short description of what it does

1. Update the file with its migration ID and the new migration scripts

1. Add the call to the migration script to setup_postgresql.sh

# How to view which migration scripts have been run and when

```
SELECT *
FROM migrations
ORDER BY id;
```
