            <dt>Last Seen (Flic)</dt>
            <dd>
                Time since the Flic Hub's MAC address did anything on the network (according to darkstat).
                This represents real activity from the Flic Hub.
            </dd>
            <dt>Last Seen (Ping)</dt>
            <dd>
                Time since the Raspberry Pi was able to ping the Flic Hub (using the IP address that darkstat 
                says is associated with the Flic Hub's MAC address). This indicates that the Flic Hub is powered 
                on and connected to the network.
            </dd>
            <dt>Last Seen (Heartbeat)</dt>
            <dd>
                Time since the Last Seen (Flic) and Last Seen (Ping) values were updated (by the Raspberry Pi 
                calling the /heartbeat endpoint on the Heartbeat Server with the newest values). This indicates 
                that the Raspberry Pi is powered on and connected to the Internet.
            </dd>
            <dt>Muted?</dt>
            <dd>
                'N' means that text messages are sent to Brave teammembers when Last Seen values cross set
                thresholds, so that we can quickly be informed about outages. 'Y' means that these text messages
                are not sent to any Brave teammembers.
