# FLIC_HUB_INTERFACE is the interface connecting the Flic Hub to the RPi (either eth0 or eth1)
# NETWORK_INTERFACE is the interface connecting the RPi to the external network (either wlan0 or eth0)
# eth0 is the builtin RPi ethernet interface. this is the interface used for PoE.
# for the Brave Hub, eth1 is the USB-to-serial adapter (if present). in general eth1 could be any other ethernet interface.
# wlan0 is the WiFi interface.
